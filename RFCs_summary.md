# Introduction
This file is a summary of:
- [RFC 2813](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc2813.txt.pdf) (Server Protocol)
- [RFC 2812](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc2812.txt.pdf) (Client Protocol)
- [RFC 2811](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc2811.txt.pdf) (Channel Management)
- [RFC 2810](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc2810.txt.pdf) (Architecture)
- [RFC 1459](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc1459.txt.pdf) (IRC Protocol)

They are the RFCs that define the IRC protocol.<br>
In this summary, we will only cover the most important parts of the RFCs,<br>
that are relevant to the implementation of our own IRC server.<br>
That means that everything related to the client side of the protocol<br>
and to the server-to-server communication will be voluntarily ignored.<br>
<br>
Note that we are using the [Augmented Backusâ€“Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form)<br>
to represent the grammar rules that apply to the different components of the IRC protocol.<br>
However, we also provided a more human-readable description of the rules for each,<br>
in the [Explained ABNF notations](#explained-abnf-notations) section.<br>

# Server specifications
The server must have a unique name, which must:
- be at most 63 characters long.
- be formated as follows:<br>
	`shortname *( "." shortname )`<br>

	where `shortname` is formatted as follows:<br>
	`( letter / digit ) *( letter / digit / "-" )`

	(click [here](#server-name--host-name) for more explanations about the above notation)

# User specifications
For every user, the server must have the following information about them:
- a unique nickname, which must:
	- be at most 9 characters long.<br>
	- be formatted as follows:<br>
		`( letter / special ) *8( letter / digit / special / "-" )`<br>

		where `special` is formatted as follows:<br>
		`%x5b-60 / %x7b-7d`

		(click [here](#user-nickname) for more explanations about the above notation)
- the name of the host that the user is running on
- the username of the user on that host

# Channel specifications
For every channel, the server must have the following information about it:
- a unique name, which must:
	- be at most 50 characters long.<br>
	- be case-insensitive.<br>
	- be formatted as follows:<br>
		`( "#" / "+" / "&" / ( "!" channelid ) ) chanstring [ ":" chanstring ]`<br>

		where:
		- `channelid` is formatted as follows:<br>
			`5( uppercase / digit )`<br>
		- `chanstring` is formatted as follows:<br>
			`*( %x01-06 / %x08-09 / %x0b-0c / %x0e-1f / %x21-2b / %x2d-39 / %x3b-ff )`

		(click [here](#channel-name) for more explanations about the above notation)
- a list of users that are on that channel
- any other data needed for the channel modes<br>
	(for example, the channel topic, a flag field, a list of the channel operators, etc...)

# Message specifications
Every message sent and received by the server must:
- be at most 512 characters long.
- be formatted as follows:<br>
	`[ ":" prefix space ] command [ params ] crlf`<br>
	
	where:
	- `prefix` is a pattern, which is formatted as described [here](#prefix),
	- `command` is a pattern, which is formatted as described [here](#command),
	- `params` is a pattern, which is formatted as described [here](#parameters),
	- `crlf` is a carriage return (`\r`) followed by a line feed (`\n`),

	(click [here](#message) for more explanations about the above notation)

Empty messages are silently ignored.

## Prefix
The purpose of the prefix is to explicitly indicate the true origin of a received message.<br>
However, the prefix is <b style="color:rgb(255 221 0)">optionnal</b>, and thus, if a received message has no prefix,<br>
it is assumed that its true origin is the connection from which it was received.<br>

Every prefix must be formatted as either one of the following:<br>
- `server`
- `nick [ [ "!" user ] "@" host ]`

where:
- `server` is formatted as described [here](#server-specifications),
- `nick` is formatted as described [here](#user-specifications),
- `user` is formatted as follows:<br>
	`1*( %x01-09 / %x0b-0c / %x0e-1f / %x21-3f / %x41-ff )`
- `host` is formatted as `server`

(click [here](#prefix-1) for more explanations about the above notation)

A prefix may be invalid for two main reasons (excluding the errors of format),<br>
and in both cases, the received messages that contain those invalid prefixes<br>
must be silently discarded:<br>
- when it identifies an unknown client.<br>
- when it identifies a known client that is not the one who sent the message.<br>
In this second case, in addition of discarding the message,<br>
the server should drop the connection with the client who sent it.

## Command
The command part of the message must be either one of the following:
- a valid IRC command (see [Command specifications](#command-specifications) section),<br>
	which must be formatted as follows:<br>
	`1*letter`
- a numeric reply code (see [Numeric reply specifications](#numeric-reply-specifications) section),<br>
	which must be formatted as follows:<br>
	`3digit`

(click [here](#command-1) for more explanations about the above notation)

## Parameters
The parameters part of the message must be formatted as either one of the following:
- `*14( space middle ) [ space ":" trailing ]`
- `14( space middle ) [ space [ ":" ] trailing ]`

where:
- `middle` is formatted as follows:<br>
	`nospcrlfcl *( ":" / nospcrlfcl )`
- `trailing` is formatted as follows:<br>
	`*( ":" / " " / nospcrlfcl )`
- `nospcrlfcl` is formatted as follows:<br>
	`%x01-09 / %x0b-0c / %x0e-1f / %x21-39 / %x3b-ff`

(click [here](#parameters-1) for more explanations about the above notation)

# Command specifications

# Numeric reply specifications
Most of the messages that the server receives from a client<br>
generate a reply to that client from the server to indicate<br>
whether the operation succeeded or failed.<br>

Numeric replies are not allowed to originate from a client;<br>
any such messages received by the server must be silently discarded.<br>

Here is a list of the different numeric replies that we will need:
- `001` : `RPL_WELCOME`<br>
	`"Welcome to the Internet Relay Network" space nick "!" user "@" host`<br>

	(click [here](#rpl_welcome) for more explanations about the above notation)

- `002` : `RPL_YOURHOST`<br>
	`"Your host is" space server "," space "running version" space version`

	(click [here](#rpl_yourhost) for more explanations about the above notation)

- `003` : `RPL_CREATED`<br>
	`"This server was created" space date`

	(click [here](#rpl_created) for more explanations about the above notation)
