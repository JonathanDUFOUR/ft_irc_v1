# Introduction
This file is a summary of:
- [RFC 2813](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc2813.txt.pdf) (Server Protocol)
- [RFC 2812](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc2812.txt.pdf) (Client Protocol)
- [RFC 2811](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc2811.txt.pdf) (Channel Management)
- [RFC 2810](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc2810.txt.pdf) (Architecture)
- [RFC 1459](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc1459.txt.pdf) (IRC Protocol)

They are the RFCs that define the IRC protocol.<br>
In this summary, we will only cover the most important parts of the RFCs,<br>
that are relevant to the implementation of our own IRC server.<br>
That means that everything related to the client side of the protocol<br>
and to the server-to-server communication will be voluntarily ignored.<br>
<br>
Note that we are using the [Augmented Backusâ€“Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form)<br>
to represent the grammar rules that apply to the different components of the IRC protocol.<br>
However, we also provided a more human-readable description of the rules for each,<br>
in the [Explained ABNF notations](#explained-abnf-notations) section.<br>

# Server specifications
The server must have a unique name, which must:
- be at most 63 characters long.
- be formated as follows:<br>
	`shortname *( "." shortname )`<br>
	where `shortname` is formatted as follows:<br>
	`( letter / digit ) *( letter / digit / "-" )`

	(click [here](#server-name) for more explanations about the above notation)

# User specifications
For every user, the server must have the following information about them:
- a unique nickname, which must:
	- be at most 9 characters long.<br>
	- be formatted as follows:<br>
		`( letter / special ) *8( letter / digit / special / "-" )`<br>
		where `special` is any of the following characters:<br>
		``[\]^_`{|}``

		(click [here](#user-nickname) for more explanations about the above notation)
- the name of the host that the user is running on
- the username of the user on that host

# Channel specifications
For every channel, the server must have the following information about it:
- a unique name, which must:
	- be at most 50 characters long.<br>
	- be case-insensitive.<br>
	- be formatted as follows:<br>
		`( "#" / "+" / "&" / ( "!" channelid ) ) chanstring [ ":" chanstring ]`<br>
		where:
		- `chanelid` is formatted as follows:<br>
			`5( uppercase / digit )`<br>
		- `chanstring` is formatted as follows:<br>
			`*(%x01-06 / %x08-09 / %x0b-0c / %x0e-1f / %x21-2b / %x2d-39 / %x3b-ff)`

		(click [here](#channel-name) for more explanations about the above notation)
- a list of users that are on that channel
- any other data needed for the channel modes<br>
	(for example, the channel topic, a flag field, a list of the channel operators, etc...)

# Message specifications
Every message received by the server must:
- be at most 512 characters long.
- be formatted as follows:<br>
	`[ ":" prefix space ] command [ params ] crlf`<br>
	where:
	- `prefix` is a pattern, which is formatted as described [here](#prefix),
	- `command` is a pattern, which is formatted as described [here](#command),
	- `params` is a pattern, which is formatted as described [here](#parameters),
	- `crlf` is a carriage return (`\r`) followed by a line feed (`\n`),

	(click [here](#messages) for more explanations about the above notation)

Empty messages are silently ignored.

## Prefix
The purpose of the prefix is to explicitly indicate the true origin of a received message.<br>
However, the prefix is <b style="color:rgb(255 221 0)">optionnal</b>, and thus, if a received message has no prefix,<br>
it is assumed that its true origin is the connection from which it was received.<br>

Every prefix must be formatted as follows:<br>
`servername / ( nickname [ [ "!" user ] "@" host ] )`
where:
- `servername` is formatted as described in the [Server specifications](#server-specifications) section,
- `nickname` is formatted as described in the [User specifications](#user-specifications) section,
- `user` is formatted as follows:<br>
	`*( %x01-09 / %x0b-0c / %x0e-1f / %x21-3f / %x41-ff )`
- `host` is formatted as `servername`

(click [here](#prefix-1) for more explanations about the above notation)

A prefix may be invalid for two main reasons (excluding the errors of format),<br>
and in both cases, the received messages that contain those invalid prefixes must be discarded:<br>
- when it identifies an unknown client.<br>
- when it identifies a known client that is not the one who sent the message.<br>
In this second case, in addition of discarding the message,<br>
the server should drop the connection with the client who sent it.

## Command
The command part may actually be an IRC command or a numeric reply code.<br>

`1*letter / 3digit`

The command part of the message must be either one of the following:
- a valid IRC command (see [Command specifications](#command-specifications) section)
- a 3 digits number that represents a reply code (see [Reply specifications](#reply-specifications) section)
